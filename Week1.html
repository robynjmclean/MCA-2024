Challenges that I may encounter when working with music and music related data include obtaining access to the music due to copyright regulations and accessibility issues. A further issue could be the compatibility of software and hardware, when the two are incompatible a loss of accurate information incurs and therefore makes working with the necessary data becomes difficult.

My selected theme may display some of these issues as it is not a new piece of work, therefore compaitibility of software of which the data is recorded might pose an issue working with today, as well as obtaining the data with full accessibility and no legal negligence.

Current manifestations of of musical data relating to Grease the musical includes both digital and physical formats. The data is curated in music catalogueing platfrms that are popular in digital culture today including spotify, apple music and Youtube where the metadata is also presetn, such as relsease date and song titles etc. As well as existing in platforms for performance purposes including Licensing libraries that hold the music data that can be released legaly for musical and theatrical production purposes, this includes instrumental arrangements and vocal scores that would be required for performance of the data in a theatrical sense.

This links to how the music is presented, through both streaming platforms digitally, physical copies such as sheet music and scores, as well as visual media through film and live perfromance.

Furthermore the msuic data of Grease the Musical is recorded as metadata, which includes data on the songs individually, such as composers and genre and album descriptions which notes if it is the original version of the song or a reproduced or re recorded which could come from a musical performance seen on for eg. Broadway.

The music is analysed in a variety of sense, the more simple being in terms of the musicological analysis where the music score is assessed (melody and lyrics) to decipher the combination of 50s rock n roll music and theatre music is discovered to be at the core of Grease's soundtrack. Similiarly cultural and thematic analysis takes place wehre is is analysed how the music impacts the society in terms of issues adressed or tackled throughout the musical pieces, this could include sexism and youth culture when referring to Grease the Musical. Finally metrics and popularity will be analysed in terms of success and how the public respond to the music itself and its performance.
