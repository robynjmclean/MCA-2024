<h2>Task 1</h2>

Musical Dataset

<h2>Task 2</h2>

Grease the Musical

<h2>Task 3</h2>

Challenges that I may encounter when working with music and music related data include obtaining access to the music due to copyright regulations and accessibility issues. A further issue could be the compatibility of software and hardware, when the two are incompatible a loss of accurate information incurs and 
therefore makes working with the necessary data becomes difficult.

My selected theme may display some of these issues as it is not a new piece of work, therefore compaitibility of software of which the data is recorded might pose an issue working with today, as well as obtaining the data with full accessibility and no legal negligence.

Current manifestations of of musical data relating to Grease the musical includes both digital and physical formats. The data is curated in music catalogueing platfrms that are popular in digital culture today including spotify, apple music and Youtube where the metadata is also presetn, such as relsease date and
song titles etc. As well as existing in platforms for performance purposes including Licensing libraries that hold the music data that can be released legaly for musical and theatrical production purposes, this includes instrumental arrangements and vocal scores that would be required for performance of the data in a theatrical sense.

This links to how the music is presented, through both streaming platforms digitally, physical copies such as sheet music and scores, as well as visual media through film and live perfromance.

Furthermore the msuic data of Grease the Musical is recorded as metadata, which includes data on the songs individually, such as composers and genre and album descriptions which notes if it is the original version of the song or a reproduced or re recorded which could come from a musical performance seen on for eg. Broadway.

The music is analysed in a variety of sense, the more simple being in terms of the musicological analysis where the music score is assessed (melody and lyrics) to decipher the combination of 50s rock n roll music and theatre music is discovered to be at the core of Grease's soundtrack. Similiarly cultural and thematic
analysis takes place wehre is is analysed how the music impacts the society in terms of issues adressed or tackled throughout the musical pieces, this could include sexism and youth culture when referring to Grease the Musical. Finally metrics and popularity will be analysed in terms of success and how the public 
respond to the music itself and its performance.

<h1>Week 2</h1>

<h2>Task 1</h2>

The piece I have chosen to work with is "Summer Nights" by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey from the Musical "Grease".
When comparing how the OMR machine transcibed the score sheet of "Summer Nights" to more complex pieces that I had put into the machine, it did a pretty good job at matching the score sheet to the original. It was able to transcribe the majority of notes in the correct place as well as matching the pitch and tone accurately, 
including the time stamp being exact. The place that the OMR mahcine struggles was identifying notes above or below the staff, and in turn would miss them out altogether, therfore changing how the piece is played. In the 7th bar of the score sheet the demiquaver above the atff was not transcibed therefor I had to add this note in myself. This is an 
example of musescore being a great tool for transcribing basic pieces, perhaps with simple melodies and a very clear and vibrant score sheet, however when it comes to more complex pieces the machine fails to keep up. It is therefor fair to say that although technology can 
be a great tool in music it cannot deliver the precise accuracy and attention to detail that the human eye provides. This would aid the view that as technology progresses and some may fear it will replace human labour, it is not at the level yet where this is a possibility right now. Coincidingly, this highlights 
that human and personal input into music in general is a key element of what makes music, music. Not only interms of transcribing oler pieces to restore or manipulate in modern use, but in general that music is a product of human creation from inspiration, therefor being purely machine produced is not the way forward and instead focus on keeping it machine aided.
