<h1>Music Analysis and Curation Portfolio</h1>

<h1>Week 1</h1>

<h2>Task 1</h2>

Musical Dataset

<h2>Task 2</h2>

Grease the Musical

<h2>Task 3</h2>

Challenges that I may encounter when working with music and music related data include obtaining access to the music due to copyright regulations and accessibility issues. A further issue could be the compatibility of software and hardware, when the two are incompatible a loss of accurate information incurs and 
therefore makes working with the necessary data becomes difficult.

My selected theme may display some of these issues as it is not a new piece of work, therefore compaitibility of software of which the data is recorded might pose an issue working with today, as well as obtaining the data with full accessibility and no legal negligence.

Current manifestations of of musical data relating to Grease the musical includes both digital and physical formats. The data is curated in music catalogueing platfrms that are popular in digital culture today including spotify, apple music and Youtube where the metadata is also presetn, such as relsease date and
song titles etc. As well as existing in platforms for performance purposes including Licensing libraries that hold the music data that can be released legaly for musical and theatrical production purposes, this includes instrumental arrangements and vocal scores that would be required for performance of the data in a theatrical sense.

This links to how the music is presented, through both streaming platforms digitally, physical copies such as sheet music and scores, as well as visual media through film and live perfromance.

Furthermore the msuic data of Grease the Musical is recorded as metadata, which includes data on the songs individually, such as composers and genre and album descriptions which notes if it is the original version of the song or a reproduced or re recorded which could come from a musical performance seen on for eg. Broadway.

The music is analysed in a variety of sense, the more simple being in terms of the musicological analysis where the music score is assessed (melody and lyrics) to decipher the combination of 50s rock n roll music and theatre music is discovered to be at the core of Grease's soundtrack. Similiarly cultural and thematic
analysis takes place wehre is is analysed how the music impacts the society in terms of issues adressed or tackled throughout the musical pieces, this could include sexism and youth culture when referring to Grease the Musical. Finally metrics and popularity will be analysed in terms of success and how the public 
respond to the music itself and its performance.

<h1>Week 2</h1>

<h2>Task 1</h2>

The piece I have chosen to work with is "Summer Nights" by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey from the Musical "Grease".
When comparing how the OMR machine transcibed the score sheet of "Summer Nights" to more complex pieces that I had put into the machine, it did a pretty good job at matching the score sheet to the original. It was able to transcribe the majority of notes in the correct place as well as matching the pitch and tone accurately, 
including the time stamp being exact. The place that the OMR mahcine struggles was identifying notes above or below the staff, and in turn would miss them out altogether, therfore changing how the piece is played. In the 7th bar of the score sheet the demiquaver above the atff was not transcibed therefor I had to add this note in myself. This is an 
example of musescore being a great tool for transcribing basic pieces, perhaps with simple melodies and a very clear and vibrant score sheet, however when it comes to more complex pieces the machine fails to keep up. It is therefor fair to say that although technology can 
be a great tool in music it cannot deliver the precise accuracy and attention to detail that the human eye provides. This would aid the view that as technology progresses and some may fear it will replace human labour, it is not at the level yet where this is a possibility right now. Coincidingly, this highlights 
that human and personal input into music in general is a key element of what makes music, music. Not only interms of transcribing oler pieces to restore or manipulate in modern use, but in general that music is a product of human creation from inspiration, therefor being purely machine produced is not the way forward and instead focus on keeping it machine aided.

<h1>Week 3</h1>

After comparing and contrasting the music.xml and the MEI rendered scores, there are a few differences including that music XML appears to be a lot more code, interms of individual tags, where as the MEI file is more compressed and concise. Further, the MEI file is much easier to look at in terms of being able to identify indivdual elements and attributes, however XML uses words that are recogniseable, such as pitch, whereas MEI uses its own sort of language for this so therefor is not as understandable at first glance nor universal in the language it uses. For example, mei uses tags such as "mei-head" as its metadata tag which is its own
language making it perhaps less convertable or generic in temrs of general language used to describe its parent and child elements. Music.XML uses more descriptive tags, such as the full word to describe the data to follow including "direction" and "harmony", whereas MEI uses the terms in a shortened manner, 
such as "dir" and "harm". This again contributes to the MEI file being less readable or easy to understand at first glance than the music.xml file. 
Finally, a simple feature that is different between the two files is the root element tag they each use, the music.xml uses "score-partwise" whereas the mei uses "mei", both do the same role in each of the files, however again the music xml is perhaps a more recognised format compared to the mei which seems to exist in its own sort of world, using specific and unique tags to mark the data to follow.

<h1>Week 7</h1>

<h2>Task 1</h2>

Justification: [I chose to use  CCO 1.0 as the licensing for my work because I have created the file as an art proect, for educational purposes therefore I feel that with these intentions this is the licensing that best alligns. CCO 1.0 is a good licensing to choose for pieces that I do not necesssarily care about
     receiving attribution whenever the work is sampled, therefore making it easier for both parties in the sense that if someone were to sample my work they wouldnt need to request permission, and likewise I wouldnt have to grant the permission which can be time saving and ost efficient for both parties. CCO 1.0 is 
    also quite a universally understood license, therefore is easy to understand and well recognised unlike some more complicated licensing that would require a lot of action and knowledge to understand the entire meaning and necessary steps to acquire the piece for sampling which can be off putting for others.
    Furthermore, CCO 1.0 allows for my work to be sampled in crative projects more wide spread as it is appealing for the reason of it belongs to the public domain. By allowing the public doman to take ownership of my work in this case this then provides opportunity for creativity and and opennes to flourish in 
    the community. This is in essence of supporrting this idea of providing resources that are available to everyone for the purpose of fueling knowledge and artistic advances. Finally, another good reason for choosing to use this licensing is that there is no risk of copyright infringement, in the sense that someone 
    who chooses to use or sample my piece is not at risk of copyrighting myself, which could have both cost consequences as well as public image, therefore the avoidmnet of this in this particular case is what I believe to be best suited.

Spectogram analysis for Grease

Evaluation: After comparing the time frequency analysis to a waveform analysis there are some clear differences in the information that can be extracted from each.
The first obvious advantage to a time frequency analysis is that it shows how a signal changes throughout the piece, showing the journey throughout the spectrum, whereas the waveform analysis can't show this progression. An attribute of the time frequency  analysis is that it is 2 dimensional, allowing it to show signal in time an frequency simultaneously, whereas a waveform analysis is one dimensional, meaning it shows this signal as intensity versus time instead. This is advantageous to the time frequency analysis because it allows for a deeper understanding of signal within the piece being studied.

When comparing the mfcc of the three tracks, they vary in terms of the x axis and the y axis in my opinion. This can be seen when looking at the hopelessly devoted mfcc track compared to the grease lightnin' mfcc track in box 12, where it can be seen that the hopelessly devoted to you track spans from -1 to 1 across the x axis, whereas the greased lightnin tracks only spans from aroun -0.5 to just before 1 on the x axis.
Furthermore when comparing the grease mfcc to the hopelessly devoted to you mfcc, it can be seen in box 15 that in teh grease track mfcc there is a steeper decline across the y axis, compared to the box 15 in the hopelessly devoted to you track that shows a steeper incline compared to decline across the y axis.
