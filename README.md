# \[Music Analysis and Curation 2679062M\]
\[Week 1 Task 2 \]
\[Musical Dataset\]
\[Task 2\]
\[Grease the Musical\]
\[Task 3\]
\[Challenges that I may encounter when working with music and music related data include obtaining access to the music due to copyright regulations and accessibility issues. A further issue could be the compatibility of software and hardware, when the two are incompatible a loss of accurate information incurs and therefore makes working with the necessary data becomes difficult\]
\[My selected theme may display some of these issues as it is not a new piece of work, therefore compaitibility of software of which the data is recorded might pose an issue working with today, as well as obtaining the data with full accessibility and no legal negligence\]
