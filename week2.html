  <h1>Week[2]</h1>
  
  <p>[The piece I have chosen to work with is "Summer Nights" by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey from the Musical "Grease".
    When comparing how the OMR machine transcibed the score sheet of "Summer Nights" to more complex pieces that I had put into the machine,
    it did a pretty good job at matching the score sheet to the original. It was able to transcribe the majority of notes in the correct 
    place as well as matching the pitch and tone accurately, including the time stamp being exact. The place that the OMR mahcine struggles was
    identifying notes above or below the staff, and in turn would miss them out altogether, therfore changing how the piece is played.
    In the 7th bar of the score sheet the demiquaver above the atff was not transcibed therefor I had to add this note in myself. This is an 
    example of musescore being a great tool for transcribing basic pieces, perhaps with simple melodies and a very clear and vibrant score
    sheet, however when it comes to more complex pieces the machine fails to keep up. It is therefor fair to say that although technology can 
    be a great tool in music it cannot deliver the precise accuracy and attention to detail that the human eye provides. This would aid the
    view that as technology progresses and some may fear it will replace human labour, it is not at the level yet where this is a possibility
    right now. Coincidingly, this highlights that human and personal input into music in general is a key element of what makes music, music.
    Not only interms of transcribing oler pieces to restore or manipulate in modern use, but in general that music is a product of human
    creation from inspiration, therefor being purely machine produced is not the way forward and instead focus on keeping it machine aided.]</p>
